# Step 1: Choosing Deployment Type

There are two Deployment Types in Sealights:

1. **Simple Deployment -** Allows for quick onboarding of a product[^1] composed of backend services for a single environment[^2] and [test stage](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. It allows you to use most of Sealights offering in a quick and easy setup. This is the recommended deployment for getting started with a new team.
2. **Advanced Deployment. -** Allows you to onboard a product[^4] composed of multiple application components (backend services and front end) for multiple environments[^5], [test stages](#user-content-fn-6)[^6], and technologies.

Today, Sealights support Simple Deployment only for Java Applications. If your application code is in another language, please refer to the [Advanced Deployment](../essentials/deployment/advanced-deployment.md) page.&#x20;

[^2]: A set of machines/containers that are hosting your System Under Test (SUT).&#x20;

[^3]: A test stage or test cycle is a collection of tests organized to accomplish specific testing objectives, encompassing a broader scope than individual tests. Common examples are Regression Tests, End-To-End Tests, Manual Tests, and more.
