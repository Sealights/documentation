# Onboarding Permissions

## Overview

Roles categorize users and define what account permissions those users have, such as what data they can read or what account assets they can modify. Sealights offers three roles: _Simple User_, _Admin User_, _DevOps User_. Each role has different permissions.

By granting permissions to roles, any user who is associated with that role receives that permission. Apart from the default permissions that a user receives with its role, a user can also be assigned certain permissions.

In order to onboard a new application, a user has to have the role of _DevOps User_.

With regards to deploying an agent on a new application, a DevOps user has **higher** permissions than AdminUser. See the [Roles and Permissions Matrix](roles-and-permissions-matrix.md) for more information. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## How to verify my role?

In order to verify your role, please follow these steps:

1. Login to the Sealights portal of your organization. The link to the portal is in the structure of `<customer>.sealights.co`, for example, https://mycompany.sealights.co.
2. Click on the avatar of your user and then click on _**My Profile**_
3. Your role appears under your name.

## What to do if I don't have the right permissions?

If you lack the permissions you need, please get in touch with the Sealights Admin in your organization. If you are uncertain who your Sealights Admin is, please get in touch with [Sealights Support](mailto:support@sealights.io).
