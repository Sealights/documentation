# Role-Based Access Control

## Overview

Roles categorize users and define what account permissions those users have, such as what data they can read or what account assets they can modify. Sealights offers three roles: _Simple User_, _Admin User_, _DevOps User_. Each role has different permissions.

By granting permissions to roles, any user who is associated with that role receives that permission. Apart from the default permissions that a user receives with its role, a user can also be assigned certain permissions.
