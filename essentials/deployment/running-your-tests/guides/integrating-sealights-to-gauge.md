# Integrating Sealights To Gauge

## Overview

[Gauge](https://gauge.org/) is a free and open-source test automation framework that takes the pain out of acceptance testing.&#x20;



We have created a sample demo project that uses the Sealights Browser Agent OTEL flavored version. The project uses the Gauge framework and relevant [execution hooks](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-js/blob/master/docs/syntax/execution-hooks.md) to report test data to Sealights and consume Test Recommendations. For more information, please visit our open-source repository at: [https://github.com/Sealights/sealights-integration-examples/tree/main/gauge-browser-agent-otel](https://github.com/Sealights/sealights-integration-examples/tree/main/gauge-browser-agent-otel)
