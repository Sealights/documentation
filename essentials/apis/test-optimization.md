# Test Optimization

## Overview

The Test Optimization API allows you to connect an unsupported test framework (manual or automated) to Sealights. It works by reporting basic metadata to Sealights and consuming the relevant test recommendation. The integration itself is quite simple, and involves few basic API calls.&#x20;

This page contains the API documentation, but if you'd like to see example guides, please refer to the [Test Optimization](../integrations/guides.md#test-optimization-guides) section in our integration guides.
